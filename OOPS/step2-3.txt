¡Ü With this, you can write code that doesn't have to change 
when you add new subclasses.

¡Ü You can easily handle a collection different objects that have the same superclass.

¡Ü ex) Create an array/ArrayList of Animals and store there all kinds of 
animals!

¡Ü Method overriding is very important in this to get different 
behavior in different classes.
